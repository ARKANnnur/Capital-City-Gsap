    history: [
      "Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, has a long history influenced by various cultures and powers. The city began as a small port known as Sunda Kelapa, under the rule of the Sunda Kingdom from the 4th to the 16th century. This port played a vital role in the spice trade between the Nusantara kingdoms and foreign merchants, particularly from India, Arabia, and China.",
      "In 1527, Fatahillah, a commander from the Demak Sultanate, successfully captured Sunda Kelapa from the Portuguese. He renamed the city Jayakarta, meaning &quot;perfect victory.&quot; In the 17th century, Jayakarta fell into the hands of the Dutch, who turned it into their administrative center in the Nusantara. The Dutch renamed the city Batavia in 1619 and made it their primary trading hub in Southeast Asia.",
      "During the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), Batavia was renamed Jakarta. After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, Jakarta became the capital of the newly-formed country. Since then, the city has evolved into Indonesia’s political, economic, and cultural hub, despite facing challenges such as rapid population growth, traffic congestion, and environmental issues.",
      "As a metropolitan city, Jakarta has played a crucial role in Indonesia’s history and development, symbolizing the nation’s independence and modernization.",

Originally, before becoming a recognized Betawi cultural icon, Ondel-Ondel was used as a talisman to ward off misfortune or evil.",
          "Ondel-Ondel figures are also gendered. Typically, the male Ondel-Ondel has a red face with thick black eyebrows, bulging eyes, a mustache, and a wide, somewhat sinister grin, yet it appears friendly. This face design is meant to evoke a sense of enthusiasm and courage, though some see it as a symbol of fierce and malevolent power.",
          "In contrast, the female Ondel-Ondel has a white face, with soft black eyes, arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, red lips, earrings, and a crown on her forehead. While her eyes are large, they are not bulging. She smiles sweetly with lips colored in red lipstick, symbolizing purity and benevolent power.",
          "Besides facial features, Ondel-Ondel can also be distinguished by their clothing. The male Ondel-Ondel typically wears dark traditional attire, while the female Ondel-Ondel is dressed in bright, plain-colored garments or floral patterns.",

For instance, in North and West Jakarta, there are more Gambang Kromong groups compared to South and East Jakarta.",

This combination causes a shift from the traditional pentatonic scale to the diatonic scale without disrupting the overall feel of the music. Despite the inclusion of modern instruments, the unique sound of Gambang Kromong remains intact, and the songs flow naturally without feeling forced.",
